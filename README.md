# A Novel Haplotype Reconstruction Method (MLHapRec)
`MLHapRec` is a maximum likelihood approach for haplotype reconstruction which uses the `[SAMFIER]`(https://github.com/cjri/samfire/blob/master/README.md) multi-locus variant calling technique for processing short-read data where samples are collected during a transmission of a virus (like influenza) from a donor to a recipient population. 

This code is originally developed for estimating the transmission bottleneck size of flu, but can be used for any other set of short-read data. 

## Data Format
This code requires Multi_locus_trajectories.out file from SAMFIER.
Below, we will discuss a scenario where we have 100 transmission events for flu virus collected from two time-points (1 before and 1 after transmission). 

## How to Compile

1- **open** blah
- `print("Hello")` 
- hi
